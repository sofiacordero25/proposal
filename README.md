# Proposal


## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The title will most likely be "Pokedex."


## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Our project is to create a Pokedex, an encyclopedia of Pokemon characters. The user will be able to browse these characters and select
a character to battle against the computer.


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The pokedex will contain a set number of pokemon characters. The user will enter a number from 1-50 and an image of a pokemon character, 
along with its name, hieight, weight, and other defining characteristics. The user will be able to pick this pokemon or will have the 
option to view others before selecting. Each pokemon will be valued with a strength unbeknownst to the user that will be used to determine 
a winner in a battle against the computer, which chooses a character randomly to fight with while showing a picture of the chosen characters 
battling.


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed 
project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I will not be combining this project with another course's final project.


## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

My groupmates are:
Matthew Burkhiemer-tui84519@temple.edu-Sai Shi
Nazli Iclal Karaman-tuo36633@temple.edu-Sai Shi


## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount 
of time than you hope.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

We will create a functional Pokedex and simulator that battles the user's chosen chracter against a computer generated randomly selected character.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final 
project's deadline?

A better outcome would include a more detailed and larger pokedex for the user to choose from.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for our project would include a more complex graphic for the battle simulation. Our basic idea is to display picutres of the chosen 
characters in the battle, but it would be awesome to develop a greater graphic for this part.


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with 
one of two classmates, who will do what?

For our final project, we will need to learn how to import images and graphics into our code and we will need to do a lot of research on Pokemon characters to 
make a complete and detailed Pokedex. Because Matt knows a lot about Pokemon, he will be leading the research and organization of the characters, while me and 
Nazli plan on working together to learn more about graphics in Python. We will start off with just the Pokedex, and then build off of it to add the
character selection and battle simulation, where the graphics will be added.
